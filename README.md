Hi ðŸ‘‹. In this repository, I document my journey through the challenging and rewarding curriculum at 42, a unique coding school where learning is a game and projects are the key to progression.


## Common Core
In the Common Core phase, I'm immersing myself in the fundamentals of programming by developing projects in C, C++, Linux, Bash, and more. This 18-month stage is the foundation of my technical skills, providing a solid understanding of coding principles.

## More Than Coding
At 42, it's not just about coding. The curriculum focuses on developing a set of 17 skills, encompassing both hard and soft skills. With each project, I earn experience points in these areas, fostering teamwork, creativity, problem-solving, and resilience.

## Personalized Learning Journey
The curriculum's flexibility allows me to personalize my learning journey, choosing projects that align with my interests and aspirations. As a result, my experience and skill set are unique, represented digitally as a chart showcasing my individualized path through the course.

Explore this repository to see my progress and the projects that shape my coding adventure at 42. Feel free to delve into the code, provide feedback, and join me on this exciting journey!

Let's code and learn together!
